SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS PERFORMANCE ADVANCED APPROACHES OF MACHINE LEARNING (IMPACTING PEOPLEâ€™S DAILY LIVES WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REVIEWS)

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is one of the major tasks of NLP (Natural Language Processing). Sentiment analysis has gained much attention in recent years. Sentiment analysis systems are being applied in almost every business and social domain because opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors. 

Our beliefs and perceptions of reality, and the choices we make, are largely conditioned on how others see and evaluate the world. For this reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out the opinions of others. This is true not only for individuals but also for organizations.

For this reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out the opinions of others. This is true not only for individuals but also for organizations. Experiments for both sentence-level categorization and review-level categorization are performed with promising outcomes.
